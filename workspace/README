Once you're using  node manager bash :
    1: Inside workspace directory you must have:
        - "install-mrjob.sh"
        - "AFINN-1111.txt"
        - "Tweets_6MB.json"
        - "Tweets_314MB.json"
        - "MRStateHappiness.py"
        - "happiest.py"

    2: Once you have all the necessary scripts and documents these are the steps to follow in order to get the results:
        - cd workspace
        - ./install-mrjob.sh 
        - bash-4.2$ python MRStateHappiness.py -r inline Tweets_314MB.json -c mrjob.conf --output-dir results
